        <h1>Brendan Shea, PhD</h1>
        <h2>Philosopher and Computer Scientist</h2>

<p>I'm originally from Eau Claire, WI, and have been programming on and off since around 10 (using BASIC on an Apple II GS). I've been at RCTC since 2013, mainly teaching in philosophy, with the occasional computer science class. Before coming to RCTC, I got my BA at Winona State University and my MA and Ph.D. (in Philosophy, with a focus on logic and philosophy of science) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (where I’m also pursuing a Masters in Computer Science). I also spent a year studying in Dublin, Ireland, at Trinity College and have a graduate certificate in computer science from the Harvard University Extension. I'm also a member of various committees and research groups at the University Minnesota-Twin Cities and Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>I enjoy my job (being a college professor is pretty awesome). Outside of that, I enjoy spending time with my wife, Anne (an occasional English and Reading teacher here at RCTC) and our son Harry (born Feb 2018). I enjoy hiking at Quarry Hill, travel, biking around town, drinking good beer and coffee, and playing Dungeons and Dragons (as a player and DM). I like reading everything: sci-fi, fantasy, “classics”, history, technical stuff on computer science/logic/whatever (I love learning new stuff!).</p>

<p>I’ve also (somehow) turned my childhood interests in robots, wizards, and the like into a series of academic articles and book chapters exploring logical and ethical puzzles in popular books, films, and TV shows. You can find much of my work here: <a href = "https://philpeople.org/profiles/brendan-shea">Brendan's PhilPeople Profile</a>.</p>

Thumb (Special Talent): I spent five years working at a grocery store in Eau Claire, WI, during high school and college. One year, I got second place in the city-wide "grocery bagging" contest and attended the state grocery-bagging contest in Milwaukee, WI. Awesome, right? .</p>
